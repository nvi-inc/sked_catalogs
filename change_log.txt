modes.cat:* 2020Jun02 JMG Added AOVSX16N. This was used in apsg47
modes.cat:* 2020Apr07 KLB Added 1Gb modes used for AOV sessions from Fengchun Shu: AOVSX16W, AVSX16N0, AVSX16N1 
modes.cat:* 2020Apr07 KLB AVSX16N1 is similar to AVSX16N0 but has a different S-band frequency sequence to 
modes.cat:* 2020Apr07 KLB accomodate RFI problems for stations like Hobart26 or Tianma65)
modes.cat:* 2020Jan06 JMG Modified so that CONT11 and 256(R1-R4) uses same frequencies. This will make correlators life easier.
